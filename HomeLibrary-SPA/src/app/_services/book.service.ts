  //         "Strikingly original in its conception, ambitious in scope, with characters engrossingly and vividly drawn, the first book in R. Scott Bakker's Prince of Nothing series creates a remarkable world from whole cloth-its language and classes of people, its cities, religions, mysteries, taboos, and rituals-the kind of all-embracing universe Tolkien and Herbert created unforgettably in the epic fantasies The Lord of the Rings and Dune. It's a world scarred by an apocalyptic past, evoking a time both two thousand years past and two thousand years into the future, as untold thousands gather for a crusade. Among them, two men and two women are ensnared by a mysterious traveler, Anasûrimbor Kellhus—part warrior, part philosopher, part sorcerous, charismatic presence—from lands long thought dead. The Darkness That Comes Before is a history of this great holy war, and like all histories, the survivors write its conclusion.",

The truth is we all have, every single one of us past the age of, say, twenty-five. The only difference is that I remember.\" No matter how hard he drinks, gambles, or womanizes, Disciple Manning simply cannot forget: not a word spoken, not an image glimpsed, not a pain suffered. Disciple Manning has total recall. Whatever he hears, he can remember with 100% accuracy. He can play it back in his head for an infinite number of times without a single change. This ability makes him a dangerously unorthodox private investigator. When a New Jersey couple hires Manning to find their daughter, who joined a religious cult before vanishing in a small rust-belt town called Ruddick, he finds himself embroiled in a mystery that will pit his unnatural ability to remember against his desperate desire to forget.

Scott Bakker delivers the feverishly harrowing and long-awaited finish to a story cycle that has stretched across seven books in two series.In The Unholy Consult, the Men of the Great Ordeal have been abandoned by Anasûrimbor Kellhus, and the grand crusade has devolved into cannibalism and chaos. When Exalt-General Proyas, with Prince-Imperial Kayutas at his side, attempts to gain control of the lost Men and continue their march to Golgotterath, it rapidly becomes clear that the lost Lord-and-Prophet is not so easily shaken from the mission. When Sorweel, the Believer-King of Sakarpus, and Serwa, daughter of the Aspect-Emperor, join the Great Ordeal, they discover that the shortest path is not always the most obvious, or the safest. Souls, morality, and relationships are called into question when no one can be trusted, and the price for their sins is greater than they imagined. An uncompromising portrayal of a catastrophic world of myth, war, and sorcery, the scope and creativity of the Aspect-Emperor books stand alongside George R. R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire. Powerful and haunting, this thrilling final installment of Bakker’s groundbreaking series promises to be one of the most talked about epic fantasy books of all time.',

The skin-spies of the Consult watch with growing trepidation.

It is crucial for electrophysiologists to diagnose arrhythmia mechanisms correctly and to optimize ablation methods, especially in Japan, one of the world’s fastest-aging countries and where many of this book’s authors are based. The volume is divided into eight parts. The first three parts present the basic theories and novel insights essential to diagnosing and performing catheter ablations. In turn, the latter five parts highlight practical ablation methods in the context of frequently encountered arrhythmias cases, as well as rare ones such as chanellopathies. Written for electrophysiologists who treat patients with cardiac arrhythmias, the book offers readers essential tips and tricks for the optimal treatment of arrhythmias.',

The book helps postgraduate students and professional scientists working in academia and industry understand the molecular mechanisms of pharmacology, current pharmacological knowledge, and future perspectives in drug discovery, focusing on important biochemical protein targets and drug targeting strategies for specific diseases. Examining the pharmacology of therapeutically undefined targets and their potential applications, it includes chapters on traditional therapeutic targets, including enzymes (phosphodiesterases and proteases), ion channels, and G protein-coupled receptors, as well as more recently identified avenues of exploration, such as lipids, nuclear receptors, gene promoters, and more. Since different diseases require different targeting techniques, the book also includes dedicated chapters on strategies for investigating Alzheimer's, diabetes, pain, and inflammation treatments. Concluding with a cross-sectional look at new approaches in drug screening, Therapeutic Targets is an invaluable resource for understanding where the next generation of drugs are likely to emerge.",

Alexeï Berg’s father is a well-known dramatist, his mother a famous opera singer. But during Stalin’s reign of terror in the 1930s they, like millions of other Russians, come under attack for their presumed lack of political purity. Harassed and proscribed, they have nonetheless, on the eve of Hitler’s war, not yet been arrested. And young Alexeï himself, a budding classical pianist, has been allowed to continue his musical studies. His first solo concert is scheduled for May 24, 1941. Two days before the concert, on his way home from his final rehearsal, he sees his parents being arrested, taken from their Moscow apartment. Knowing his own arrest will not be far behind, Alexeï flees to the country house of his fiancée, where again betrayal awaits him. He flees, one step ahead of the dreaded secret police until, taking on the identity of a dead soldier, he enlists in the Soviet army. Thus begins his seemingly endless journey, through war and peace, until he lands, two decades later, in a snowbound train station in the Urals, where he relates his harrowing saga to the novel’s narrator. An international bestseller, Music of a Life is, in the words of Le Monde, “extremely powerful . . . a gem.”',
